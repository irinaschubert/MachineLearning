# Machine Learning
Here I collect some useful jupyter notebooks I used for machine learning. The repo was set up for the course "Machine Learning" at Fernfachhochschule Schweiz. We had to participate in Kaggle competitions (https://www.kaggle.com/), so most of the notebooks were written for this reason.
