# Machine Learning
Here I collect some useful jupyter notebooks and python scripts I used for machine learning. I set up the repo for the course "Machine Learning" at Fernfachhochschule Schweiz. As we had to participate in Kaggle competitions (https://www.kaggle.com/), most of the notebooks and scripts were written for this purpose and competition specific tasks.
